# Frontend React App

This directory contains a simple React application written in TypeScript.

## Setup

Run `npm install` to install dependencies, then `npm start` to run the development server.
The project uses TypeScript, so `.tsx` files live in the `src` directory and are compiled using `react-scripts`.
